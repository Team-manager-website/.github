# Team Manager

## About me
My name is [CÃ©dric Berden](https://github.com/basjebasie), I am studying ICT at Fontys university of applied sciences. Currently I am in semester 3 when I work on this project.

## The Idea
I want to create a team manager system that makes it easier and clearer to make agreements in a sports team. Where you can easily see an overview so that no one forgets anything. The application has arranged various things such as who should take the balls home after the game. The other thing I want is to display the team pot clearly on the website and give fines to show this via the app and to confirm if it has been paid. This also informs the rest of the team that a certain fine is being paid.
